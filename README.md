# Satellite Motion Estimation using Kalman Filter
In the following example, we'll attempt to estimate the location of a satellite using its motion equations as our model, along with noisy measurements of the satellite's location taken every few seconds.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Matlab or any other software capable of running *.m files installed on your machine.

### Running
```bash
run main.m
```

- All the necessary files are referred to from the main file.
- All the plotting files begin with 'plotting_*.m' and can be adjusted to your needs.
